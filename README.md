# University-Physics-Cup-2020-Problem-B: Study of Quadcopter Stability in Wind
This work basically presents the analytical work for solving the problem "B" of "UPC-2020"

## Abstract

<p align =" justify"> 
  
This paper presents a detailed study highlighting various types of wind effects on the
quadcopter dynamics. With that purpose in mind different mathematical models of
winds have been properly explored. Besides their effectiveness for determining wind
speed as well as quadcopter stability is presented in this paper.</p>

To propose a solution for maximum wind speed with the constraint of maintaining
quadcopter stability, several simulations have been performed varying the magnitude
and direction of wind velocity. For simulation purposes,“Matlab” is used. These numerical simulations have strengthened our theoretical analysis.

In numerical simulations, we have endeavored to simulate the effects of several parameters on the wind speed. In this way, we can have an idea about the possible
maximum wind speed. In fact we have tried to incorporate effects of varying wind
speed, wind direction, and also deviations from the target location.
From these analyses, we can assert that the maximum wind speed for stable as well
as the safe operation of quadcopter might be in the range from 3.41m/s to 5.62 m/s.
The logical reasoning behind this inference has been extensively discussed in this paper.
In addition to that, we have tried to implement a quadcopter stability analysis with
real world windy situations. In a nutshell, this paper presents a precise theoretical as
well as numerical analysis of the quadcopter stability considering wind effects. </p>  

## Restatement of the Problem

<p align ="justify">
As per the problem statement, we have an already designed quadcopter UAV of mass 1.5kg.
It has four rotors arranged in square and each rotor is centered at a equal distance from
its center of mass. Therefore, the whole system is surely a symmetric one. Each rotor
can supply thrust of maximum seven Newtons when needed. Now we have to consider
a practical case of wind disturbance on the copter. Wind flows of varied magnitude and
direction are affecting the system and in this case, we have to find the threshold wind
speed so that the system can operate safely and stay within 20 cm of a target location.</p>
